note: this is a list of every RPC that is canonicaly located at Site-002. Not all of these necessarily will appear in the actual game. that said, it would be nice if each RPC here is at least refferenced.

ENEMIES

[RPC-005](http://www.rpc-wiki.net/rpc-005) - Queen of the South Sea: likely serve as a background character, only making an appearance near the surface, if at all.

[RPC-077](http://www.rpc-wiki.net/rpc-077) - The Grandmother: First appears not far from her cell, offering the player candy. If the player refuses, she will insist they take it. Eventually she will attempt to force-feed the player, her form twisting more and more until her true form is revealed. Afterwards, she becomes a recurring enemy, squeezing herself through small cracks and crevises to get the drop on the player.

[RPC-129-A](http://www.rpc-wiki.net/rpc-129) - They Grow on You: It will try to hug anyone it sees, absorbing them and getting bigger. could become really big if not contained quickly.

[RPC-484](http://www.rpc-wiki.net/rpc-484) - the Green Man: will be trying to escape, and will attack and/or infect you if you get in its way, but will otherwise ignore you. Unless you're holding a weapon, then it or its infected will attack you. gains more infected as the game progresses.

[RPC-818](http://www.rpc-wiki.net/rpc-818) - Tree Huggers: may have gotten out of their cell, and in such a case will be lurking in a room that best fits their hunting habits (lots of hanging lights, support beams, tall shelves, exposed pipes and vents, or other such things for them to climb and pounce from) and will attack you.

[RCP-929](http://www.rpc-wiki.net/rpc-929) - Faulty Authoritarian Shock Trooper: hostile to any Authority personel. Might not attack you if you're a CSD or Janitor, or if you're following RPC-121, but otherwise the player would be best advised to stay as far away from that thing as possible.

NEUTRAL

[CSD-2243](http://www.rpc-wiki.net/lo-067-testing-log) - Honey I Shrunk the CSD: Found in a shoebox-sized container in a biological wing. Will plead for you to take him and his contianer with you, or to be let out and taken with you. Maybe you can use him to activate  an inaccessible switch or something.

[CSD-0748](http://www.rpc-wiki.net/lo-067-testing-log) - A Small-Spoken Giantess: Can be found hiding in her contianment area. Could be used to re-contain RPC-129-A. Could also possibly be convinced by RPC-121 to help escape.

[RPC-105](http://www.rpc-wiki.net/rpc-105) - The Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy (of Company B): will probably stay in his cell. Maybe you can listen to his music to regain health or sanity (if we have a sanity meter in the game).

[RPC-121](http://www.rpc-wiki.net/rpc-121) - Smug AI: Can give you information about a way out, as well as a warning of an incoming danger. Can possibly be taken with you and plugged into another device to open a door or something? Might also try to convince you to help some of the anomalies escape.

[RPC-183](http://www.rpc-wiki.net/rpc-183) - the Cosmetic Surgeon: will probably stay in his cell.

[RPC-092](http://www.rpc-wiki.net/rpc-092) - The Golem Stone: slowly petrifies the player, slowing them down. however, if they reach it in time, they will lose their status affects and already petrified individuals will start defending them. Maybe a member of the Church of Malphus is wielding it as an enemy.

[RPC-136](http://www.rpc-wiki.net/rpc-136) - Payback Tires: Its room may have suffered a blackout, and the tires may be found rolling themselves around. If you shine a flashlight directly on one of them, the talons will instantly disappear and their movement will go to the physics engine. If you knock one of them over, they'll percieve that as an attack and start chasing you.

[RCP-172](http://www.rpc-wiki.net/rpc-172) - Funny Feeling: kept in a cold storage room. the container may have broken and you'll need a hazmat suit to enter safely.

[RPC-220](http://www.rpc-wiki.net/rpc-220) - Stardust: would probably just be in a fusion reactor. Maybe the casing breaks and you need to wear a hazmat suit to enter the room?

[RPC-371](http://www.rpc-wiki.net/rpc-371) - "The Box Changes Allâ€¦": the logos would be covered by stickers with "RPC-371" on it. You probably won't be able to turn it on due to copyright reasons, but there may be a few affected individuals. Maybe it turns itself on if you look at the screen?

INTERACTIBLES

[LO-067](http://www.rpc-wiki.net/catalog-of-lesser-anomalous-items) - telescope: you could look through this to get to some far away area, or maybe it could be aimed at a table and you need to use it to shrink down and do something to unlock a door or hide from an anomaly.

[RPC-076](http://www.rpc-wiki.net/rpc-076) - Hidden In Plain Sight: 

[RPC-127](http://www.rpc-wiki.net/rpc-127) - Cloud Coverage: you'd find it's document, but since it's being used as a means of forcing people to submit to the authority, it won't be on site.

[RPC-358](http://www.rpc-wiki.net/rpc-358) - the Love Interest: You can find the DVD, but you can't play it. Maybe RPC-121 can interact with RPC-358-1, but probably not.
