rooms are mounted on cavern walls with catwalks running between them, with the bottommost containment level being the cave floor, with tunnels carved into the walls for different zones.

Containment cells are small concrete and steel bunkers with a power generator, water tank, and steel grooves to allow for mounting on wall-mounted beams for hooking up to test chambers.
the Containment level is littered with forklifts, hydraulic dollies, and cargo cranes.
